# Example ChatGPT Plugin for Cloudflare Workers

This is an example plugin showing how to build [ChatGPT plugins](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/introduction) using [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.dev). Using this example, you can deploy a plugin to Cloudflare Workers in just a few minutes.

The sample plugin allows ChatGPT users to search for repositories using GitHub's search API. The plugin is implemented in TypeScript and uses the [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specification to define the plugin's API.
